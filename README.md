## Challenges and Learning Experience

During this project, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow and refine my skills:

- The biggest challenge I faced was creating tables using Excel sheets, as I was not familiar with it. However, I had a great adventure working through this problem and improving my proficiency.
- Working with the **AG Grid** library was a completely new experience for me. It took a considerable amount of time to understand its functionality, but in the end, I was able to implement it successfully.
- The **planning and chart** part of the project was the most demanding task, as it required combining multiple sheets and performing complex calculations. Despite the difficulties, I managed to overcome these challenges through perseverance and problem-solving skills.

I hope you will like this project and appreciate the effort and dedication that went into building it.

# If I had 4 more hours then

- I will write more test cases for different comopnents.
- Write common functions for reading and storing data of excel files.
- Making user authentication dynamic and adding OAuth logins with it.
